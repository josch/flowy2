 * one can have a switch over them.
 *
 * the comparison constants come first as they are not of the size of a power
 * of two and hence, would create wholes in the range of possible values for
 * grouper_rule.op which in turn would make it harder for the compiler to
 * optimize the switch. It is generally better if the possible values for the
 * switch statement are continuous because then, a branchtable can be built.
